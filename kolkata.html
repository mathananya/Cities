		<h1>Kolkata</h1>
		
		<div id = "intro">
		<strong>Kolkata</strong> /ko älÀàk…ëÀêt…ô/ ([kolkatÃ™a] (About this sound listen), 
		also known as <i>Calcutta</i> /k√¶lÀàk åt…ô/, the official name until 2001) is the capital 
		of the Indian state of <strong>West Bengal</strong>. Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River,
		 it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of East India, 
		 while the Port of Kolkata is India's <em>oldest operating port</em> and its sole major 
		 riverine port. The city is widely regarded as the "cultural capital" of India, 
		 and is also nicknamed the <i>"City of Joy"</i>. In 2011, the city had a population of 
		 4.5 million, while the population of the city and its suburbs was 14.1 million, 
		 making it the <em>third-most populous</em> metropolitan area in India. Recent estimates 
		 of Kolkata Metropolitan Area's economy have ranged from $60 to $150 billion 
		 (GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity) making it third most-productive 
		 metropolitan area in India, after Mumbai and Delhi.[12][13][14]

		 <div id = "history">
		In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by 
		the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East 
		India Company a trading licence in 1690,[16] the area was developed by the 
		Company into an increasingly fortified trading post. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah 
		occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following 
		year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local 
		rule), and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule, and 
		later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held 
		territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, 
		combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, led to a shift of the capital to 
		New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement; it 
		remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. Following Indian independence 
		in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, 
		culture, and politics, suffered several decades of economic stagnation.

		As a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th-century Bengal Renaissance and a 
		religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in Bengal and India, 
		Kolkata has local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature. Many 
		people from Kolkata‚Äîamong them several Nobel laureates‚Äîhave contributed to the 
		arts, the sciences, and other areas. Kolkata culture features idiosyncrasies 
		that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle 
		intellectual exchanges (adda). West Bengal's share of the Bengali film industry 
		is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of 
		national importance, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, 
		the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum and the National Library of India. Among 
		professional scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural 
		Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, 
		the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the 
		Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological 
		Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Though home to major 
		cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by 
		giving importance to association football and other sports.
